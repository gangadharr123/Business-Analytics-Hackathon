# Commute Reliability Estimator: EBS Business Analytics Hackathon

## Project Overview
**Goal:** Develop a data-driven tool to estimate the probability of public transport delays for commuters traveling to the university.

Reliable commuting is essential for students and staff at EBS University. While public transport operators provide real-time delay information, commuters often lack *ex-ante* (forecasted) information about how reliable a specific connection typically is. This project aims to support better decision-making under uncertainty by analyzing historical data to quantify delay risks.

## The Problem
Students are often delayed to class because trains are delayed. The complexity of the problem arises from several factors:
* **Variability:** Trains have different reliability levels at different times of the day and days of the week.
* **Network Effects:** When multiple trains or connections are involved, forecasting becomes increasingly complex.
* **Information Gap:** It takes time for a student to empirically learn which trains are trustworthy. Current apps provide real-time status but lack historical reliability metrics.

## The Task
**Objective:** Estimate Delay Risk for Commuting to the University.

In this hackathon, we are developing a data-driven tool that estimates the probability of delays based on historical data. 
* **Scope:** The task is **not** to predict exact delays in real-time.
* **Outcome:** The goal is to provide a probabilistic estimation of reliability to support planning (e.g., "This connection has an 85% chance of arriving on time on Mondays at 8:00 AM").
